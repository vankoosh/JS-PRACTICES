Currying in JavaScript
Currying is a functional programming technique.

This article will discuss currying, a functional programming technique we can use to write code that is modular, easy to
test, and highly reusable. Functional programming is a declarative paradigm that emphasizes immutability and pure
functions — meaning the function is side-effect free and for any given input it will always return the same output.

This helps make code more readable and easier to reason about in general, and currying is just one part of it. Let’s get
started with currying!

How currying works
In order to understand the point of currying and how it works, we can first look at a non-curried function.

Below, we’ve created a non-curried function add(). add() will still execute if called with a missing argument, which
would result in the missing variable being evaluated as undefined. For the add() function below, if add() was called
with an argument for a but not for b, the function call would evaluate as 1 + undefined and return NaN. That’s not great
and could be tricky to debug in practice.

function add(a,b) {
return a + b;
}

Why does this happen? If add() is missing an argument when it’s called, it will evaluate the function call as add(a,
undefined). For example, if we use 1 as an argument for the variable a and no argument for b, calling add(1) would run
as add(1, undefined).

Function call: → Evaluated as:
add(1) → add(1, undefined)
Let’s curry the add() function to see how we can handle the function call better if only one argument is available. What
we can do is transform the add() function, which normally expects multiple arguments, into a series of nested functions
that will each take a single argument.

This makes the function calls more modular. With curried functions, calling the outer function returns the next function
in the chain and so on until the innermost function is called, which then returns a value.

In code that would look like this:

// traditional function
function add(a,b) {
return a + b;
}

// curried function
function curried_add(a) {
// The outer function returns a nested single-argument function
return function nested_func(b) {
return a + b;
}
}
What we did in the code is declare curried_add() as a function that takes a single argument and returns another function
named nested_func(). (The returned function can also be anonymous, but has a name in this example for clarity.)

Calling the outer function curried_add() returns nested_func().
Calling nested_func uses the arguments supplied from calling curried_add and nested_func to return the evaluated result
of a + b.
When you call curried_add(a), the returned output is the function nested_func(b). Then you can call nested_func(b) and
the output will be the evaluated result of a + b.

Function call: → Returns:
curried_add(1) → nested_func(b)
nested_func(b) → a + b
You can call that in your code as curried_add(a)(b), which invokes curried_add(), then invokes nested_func() immediately
following the first function call.

Let’s break that down further. In the code block below, we are assigning the result of calling curried_add() to a
variable named add_one.

let add_one = curried_add(1);
// returns nested_func()
Now, when we call add_one(), it will return the value of a + b, because it is the function nested_func().

add_one(10);
// returns 11
The argument from calling curried_add() is available to the nested functions due to closure. A closure means that the
nested function retains the scope of parent functions based on where the function is defined, even if the nested
function is executed outside of that lexical scope.

You may recall that a function can access variables both in its inner and outer scope. That behavior is an example of
lexical scoping rules, which means the scoping is based on the structure of the code.

Taking that one step further, when a function is invoked, lexical scoping is retained. So nested functions will continue
to have access to any variables that are declared in the outer scope of parent functions. This is true even if that
parent function is done executing.

Overall, that means that when you run the line let add_one = curried_add(1); , add_one() will retain the scope from
curried_add() and therefore have access to the variable created for the argument a as 1, which you can see explained in
the code snippet line by line:

function curried_add(a) {
// has access to the argument for a
return function nested_add(b) {
// has access to the arguments for a and b
return a + b;
}
}

// creates a local variable a and assigns it the value 1
let add_one = curried_add(1);

// add_one() still has access to the argument from curried_add()
add_one(10);
Code Challenge
Declare a variable named nestedFunction and set it equal to curriedMultiply() called with a number argument.

Declare a second variable, result and set it equal to nestedFunction() called with a number argument.

If you console.log() result, it should log a number.

12345678
function curriedMultiply(a) {
return function(b) {
return a * b
}
}
// Write your code here
const nestedFunction = curriedMultiply(2);
const result = nestedFunction(4);

Code Challenge
The function makeGreeting() takes one string argument.

Write additional code to make makeGreeting() return a function.

The returned function should return a concatenation of the first string, a space, and the second string, such as “Hello
World”.

You can uncomment the lines below the function to check your work.

12345678910
function makeGreeting(string) {
//Write your code here
return string2 => {
return string + ' ' + string2;
}

}
let hello = makeGreeting('Hello');
let helloWorld = hello('World');
console.log(helloWorld);

Currying with Arrow Functions
The same curried_add() function from earlier can be rewritten much more concisely using ES6 arrow function syntax:

let curried_add = a => b => a + b;
Let’s break that down:

let curried_add is a variable assignment to the outer arrow function, a => ....
Calling curried_add takes an argument a and returns b => a + b.
Invoking the second arrow function returns the sum, or a + b.
Code Challenge
Rewrite the function changeColor() with arrow expression syntax and assign it to the variable changeColorArrow.

123456789
function changeColor(color) {
return function(obj) {
obj.color = color;
}
}

// write your code here
let changeColorArrow = color => obj => obj.color = color;

Currying in Context
Now that we understand the basics of how currying works, let’s look at a use case that’s more interesting than addition.

For this example, a social sports league company needs a way to filter through an array of players from various cities,
sports leagues, and age brackets to generate some graphs about their player data in a dashboard. Each time they generate
a list of filtered values, they have to repeat filters that iterate over the entire players array, so they want to
modify their code.

const players = [
{ age: 5, sport: "soccer", city: "Chicago", dateJoined: new Date('2021-01-20') },
{ age: 6, sport: "baseball", city: "Boulder", dateJoined: new Date('2019-12-30') },
{ age: 10, sport: "soccer", city: "Chicago", dateJoined: new Date('2020-11-12') },
{ age: 11, sport: "handball", city: "San Francisco", dateJoined: new Date('2020-08-21') },
{ age: 6, sport: "soccer", city: "Chicago", dateJoined: new Date('2021-07-06') },
{ age: 8, sport: "softball", city: "Boulder", dateJoined: new Date('2019-02-27') },
{ age: 7, sport: "tennis", city: "San Francisco", dateJoined: new Date('2019-05-31') },
{ age: 4, sport: "handball", city: "San Francisco", dateJoined: new Date('2018-03-10') }
]
Let’s say they’re interested in seeing all players from the city of San Francisco sorted by age as well as seeing all
players in San Francisco who play handball. We can filter over the array of objects to grab the relevant objects, then
sort the results or do additional filtering.

Below, sortPlayersByValueFromCity() takes three arguments:

an array of players
the city to filter by
a sort key to sort by
The function filters the array of objects by the city key, then sorts by the sort criteria.

const sortPlayersByValueFromCity = (playersArr, city, sortKey) => {
return playersArr.filter(player => {
return player.city === city;
}).sort((a,b) => {
return a[sortKey] - b[sortKey]
});
}

console.log(sortPlayersByValueFromCity(players, "San Francisco", "age"));
Meanwhile, in the following code block, filterPlayersByValueFromCity() takes four arguments:

an array to filter
a city to filter the array by
an additional filter key,
the matching filter value to search for
The function filters by the city then filters the results by the key-value pair.

const filterPlayersByValueFromCity = (playersArr, city, filterKey, filterValue) => {
return playersArr.filter(player => {
return player.city === city;
}).filter(playersFromCity => playersFromCity[filterKey] === filterValue)
}

console.log(filterPlayersByValueFromCity(players, "San Francisco", "sport", "handball"));
There are a couple things you should notice about those functions:

Both functions are filtering by city and performing the same filter each time the function is executed for San
Francisco.
Both functions take several arguments.
Let’s make the code more modular with currying to eliminate potential problems in the code and to avoid repeating the
repetitive filter operations.

Identify errors faster
Say that we call filterPlayersByValueFromCity() as filterPlayersByValueFromCity(players, "San Fran", "sport"). The
returned result is going to be an empty array. There are several things wrong with that function call, but it will still
run and it will be unclear why an empty array was returned. The errors include:

San Francisco is input as San Fran.
The fourth argument is missing.
As we covered earlier in the article, with currying, we can guarantee the final filter will not execute until all
arguments have been entered and each nested function has been called. Since you’re handling each argument one off in
single argument functions, you can handle validating each argument as you go through the chain and hone in on any
argument errors before code proceeds or has a chance to return an empty array.

Make Code Easier to Read and Reuse
The code for sortPlayersByValueFromCity() and filterPlayersByValueFromCity() is hard to read. With currying, we can
write functions that handle one task, and are therefore not only easier to read and understand, but more reusable. For
example, we can create a curried function that filters an array of objects by a provided key and value.

const setFilter = array => key => value => array.filter(x => x[key] === value);
const filterPlayers = setFilter(players);
const filterPlayersByCity = filterPlayers('city');
const filteredPlayersBySanFrancisco = filterPlayersByCity('San Francisco');
const filterPlayersBySport = filterPlayers('sport');
const filteredPlayersBySoccer = filterPlayersBySport('soccer');

console.log(filteredPlayersBySanFrancisco); // Returns an array of players from San Francisco
console.log(filteredPlayersBySoccer); // Returns an array of players that play soccer
Make Code More Modular
Now we can reuse the filtered San Francisco object for additional specialized functions. Let’s use it to sort the
players by the date they joined the sports league.

const sortArrayByValue = sortArray => sortKey => {
return sortArray.sort(function(a, b){
if(a[sortKey] < b[sortKey]) { return -1; } if(a[sortKey]> b[sortKey]) { return 1; }
  return 0;
  });
  }

  const sortSanFrancisco = sortArrayByValue(filteredPlayersBySanFrancisco);
  const sortSFByDateJoined = sortSanFrancisco("dateJoined");
  console.log(sortSFByDateJoined);
  Summary
  In this article, we took a look at how currying works under the hood thanks to closures in JavaScript, and how you can
  use different syntax techniques to curry your functions. Overall, thanks to the modularity of curried functions, you
  can now use currying in your code to make your functions have a single purpose and therefore be easier to test, debug,
  maintain, and read.
